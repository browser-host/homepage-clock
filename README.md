# Custom Browser Homepage [WIP]
This is a rebuild of my previous custom browser homepage that I build using React.js and Tailwind CSS instead of plain HTML, JS, and CSS.

Tech used:
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- gh-pages
- react-icons

Looks like this currently:

Check out the live version:
https://browser-host.github.io/homepage-clock/

## How to make it yours:
1. Clone the project
2. Setup GitHub Pages for the repository to deploy from branch
3. Select 'gh-pages' branch as the branch to deploy from
4. Use a browser plugin to set your site as the browser's homepage
5. Make any changes you want, remember to run 'npm run deploy' to see your changes live

I use New Tab Homepage for Firefox


## Upcoming Changes
1. Different themes to chose from
2. Local weather report
