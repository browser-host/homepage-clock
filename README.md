# Custom Browser Homepage [WIP]
This is a rebuild of my previous custom browser homepage that I build using React.js and Tailwind CSS instead of plain HTML, JS, and CSS.

Tech used:
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- gh-pages
- react-icons

Looks like this currently:

Check out the live version:
https://browser-host.github.io/homepage-clock/

## How to make it yours:
1. Clone the project
2. Find the getWeatherData() function and change the api key in the get request to your own free key from weatherapi.com
3. Change the location in the get request to your own local weather
4. Setup GitHub Pages for the repository to deploy from branch
5. Select 'gh-pages' branch as the branch to deploy from
6. Use a browser plugin to set your site as the browser's homepage
7. Make any other changes you want, remember to run 'npm run deploy' to see your changes live

I use New Tab Homepage for Firefox


## Upcoming Changes
1. Different themes to chose from
2. Local weather report
